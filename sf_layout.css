/* HTML and Body Styles */  

/*I used the background color rule to make the whole web page the color i wanted then I also made the font size of it 12 pixels
and what I wanted the font family to be. This all effected the html protion of the website. 
Next I worked on the body and how I wanted that to look, first I started with the background dolor of that which I used white
then how wide I wanted the margin of the body and the wdiths.*/

html {
   background-color: rgb(61, 226, 226);

/* Body Header Navigation Styles */

/*I worked a lot in the body header naviggation styles, the first thing I did was effect the header who is a child of the body. I
chose a background color of white and the height of the header to be 300 pixels, margin was also the same pixels as height.
Last I workded on the postion of eveything which helps me work place an element where I want it.
Next I worked on the links in the nav. I chose the id top.links which are in the nav and the nav is a child of the header who is
a chid of the body. Then all I did was float them right add margin and position.*/

body > header {
   background-color: white;

   float: right;
   margin: 10px;
   width: 40%;
}

/*I used the same elements but at I'm not only effecting the toplinks id im effecting the lists as well. I created a font family,
and the sizing of the letters. Then where I wanted them to be placed and how much space I wanted in between the letters. Then I 
added margin spaces at the top and added width to them and lastly made the text centered.*/

body > header > nav.toplinks li {

   margin-top: 50px;

   text-align: center;
}

/*For the mext two lines of code I needed to effect the toplinks lists that where in the nav and when they were visited as well 
as the toplinks in the nav lists when linked. I just added a color to this one.
The next one I used the same elements except instead of visited I switched It to active and instead of link I put hover, so when
you hover your curser over the links in the nav they will turn to the color that was set. */

   color: rgb(20, 167, 170);

/*In the next two lines of code I needed to effect the tabs that are in the nav who are a child of the header who is a child of
the body. I used the rules position to put the elements were I wanted and made the bottom of the tabs 0 pixels and changed the
height and width of the tabs as well.
For the second line of code I used the same elements effected but it added at the end of tabs the word after which means that 
after, then I added the clear element to both sides to assure no float can be added. As well as adding content to determine what
page based occurence can be given to an element. Last I added a display of table to shape the tabs.*/

/*These two sections of code effect the unordered lists in a tab and another list in the same tab. The first section is
effecting an unordered list in the tabs id of the nav who is a child of the header who is a child of the body. I used position
to put the elements where I wanted and the bottom and width as well. 
The second section of code is a lot but it was simple, we're effecting the list in tabs in the nav who is a child of the header
who is a child of the body. I first needed to put a backgroun color which is a light blue then I displayed it in a block that
floats left and has a height of 40 pixels. Then I needed to space out the letters to 3 pixels and the line height to 40pixels
then i just added margins to the left and right and the width. */

first of type list in the id tabs in the nav who is a child of the header who is a child of the body. Then I added a background 
color and a margin to the left.
The second section of code is efecting the same thing but we are just adding margin to the right as well.
Lastly we have the 3rd section of code that is effecting the id of all a in a list in the tabs id in the nav who is a child of
header who is a child of the body. I added a color then displayed it as block then aligned it to the center and added a width of

/*In the sections layouts I start with the section left id to make that section float left and add some margin to the top and
add some padding to the bottom and made the width 20%.

The second section of code is effecting the same section except after the class vertical we are now effecting the header. Which we
want to be white and the background color to be a light bright blue and the font size, height to be 30 pixels. Then align the text
to the center and add a width of 100%.
